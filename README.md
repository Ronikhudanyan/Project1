# Project1
Create a flappy bird style game that can then be multiplayer

setup:
create a ground, sky, a flying object and obstacles 
-This is done in CS

flying object will then fly through the map and try to avoid the tunnels
-This is done using .getelement by Id or add divs for the tunnels 
-move the tunnels  forward towards the left of the screen and make them appear at random heights (using math random)
-create the tunnels and makee them move across the pixels 
-flyig object is being pushed down by gravity (subtract the amount of pixels unless the space bar is clicked then move up by adding px)

create a jump function
-this function will allow for the sace bar to be used to move the object against gravity

-create a board telling you how many lives you have left

-create a landing page for the start of the game

-try to give sound to the game

-once game is over, give an option for reset button
